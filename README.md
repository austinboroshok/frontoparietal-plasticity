Description of files within this repository:

    'myelin_mapping_paper_data.csv' contains all imaging and behavioral data collected during this study and used for analysis.

    'myelin_mapping_paper_data_dictionary.csv' provides a desription of each variable within the master dataset ('myelin_mapping_paper_data.csv')

    'myelin_mapping.R' contains the code used to run all analyses and create all figures within the paper


Imagine Processing Pipeline:
We uploaded four folders ('DTI,' 'Myelin Mapping,' 'Resting State,' and 'Task/FEAT') that contain all scripts used to process participants' MRI data. Below we have listed a description of all files within each of these folders:

DTI:



Myelin Mapping:
  
    'MyelinMap.sh'
    
    'MyelinMap_parallel.sh'
